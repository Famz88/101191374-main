            <h2>What is an IP?</h2>
            <p> An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.</p>
            <p>In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network: they contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.</p>

        <h3>What is TCP/IP?</h3>
        <p>TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet. TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).</p>
        <p>The entire IP suite -- a set of rules and procedures -- is commonly referred to as TCP/IP. <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/TCP">TCP</a> and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchunifiedcommunications/definition/Internet-Protocol">IP</a> are the two main protocols, though others are included in the suite. The TCP/IP protocol suite functions as an abstraction layer between internet applications and the routing and switching fabric.</p>
        <p>TCP/IP specifies how data is exchanged over the internet by providing end-to-end communications that identify how it should be broken into packets, addressed, transmitted, routed and received at the destination. TCP/IP requires little central management and is designed to make networks reliable with the ability to recover automatically from the failure of any device on the network.</p>

        <h4>What is OSI Model?</h4>
        <p> OSI stands for Open System Interconnection is a reference model that describes how information from a software application in one computer moves through a physical medium to the software application in another computer.</p>
          <ul>
              <li>OSI consists of seven layers, and each layer performs a particular network function.</li>
            <li>OSI model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984, and it is now considered as an architectural model for the inter-computer communications.</li>
            <li>OSI model divides the whole task into seven smaller and manageable tasks. Each layer is assigned a particular task.</li>
            <li>Each layer is self-contained, so that task assigned to each layer can be performed independently.</li>
